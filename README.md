Much of this stuff can be found on the freecodecamp YouTube channel, but a few of them are me just messing around with code and trying to learn from what I watched. Some insights
that may seem obvious to some are that the syntax of this language is quite similar to c++, but there are of course exceptions, and this language is very object oriented, so 
you are always really working with classes and objects.
